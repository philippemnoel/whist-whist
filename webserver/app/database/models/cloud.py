"""SQLAlchemy models

In this module, we define Python models that represent tables in our PostgreSQL database
with the schema cloud. Each model's attributes are automatically loaded from database
column names when we call ``DeferredReflection.prepare()`` in ``app/utils/flask/factory.py``.

Note that SQLAlchemy is unable to reflect primary key constraints from views automatically. For
models representing SQL views (e.g. :class:`LingeringInstances`), the attribute representing the
primary key column must be defined explicitly.
