# This file holds the utility library for EC2 (AWS cloud compute) instance orchestration
# Specifically, it governs instance starting, stopping, and getting
# the IPs of running instances, as well as some useful state checkers.
# Tests live in helpers_tests/aws_tests/test_ec2_client.py, and those tests also demonstrate
# common usage.
