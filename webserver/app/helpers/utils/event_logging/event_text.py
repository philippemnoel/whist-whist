# this is meant to help us format event text since
# we will need the text to be formatted to do more interesting logs
# (possible in the future it may be better to straight up do like a pickle
# or something - yea funniest thing I've ever seen)

# the format we have picked is a key-value format that is like this:
#
# key1:val1\nkey2:val2:\n...
#
# it is easy to parse -- split by \n,
# this is never going to be present in the timestamp/numerical values
# or names we have, and then split by (:, 1) i.e. the very first colon since the key will not
# have a colon, even if the value might)
