"""Flask application configuration.

This module contains definitions of objects that are used to configure the Flask application a la
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/config/#development-production. Depending on the
environment in which the Flask application is being deployed, one of these configuration objects is
selected to be used to configure the application. For example, if the application factory detects
that the application is being deployed during a local test session, LocalTestConfig will be
selected; if the application factory detects that the application is being deployed to production
on Heroku, the DeploymentConfig class will be selected. The configuration object is then
instantiated and the Flask application is configured by flask.Config.from_object().
