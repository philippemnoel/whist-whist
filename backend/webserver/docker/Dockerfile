# USAGE: docker build --file docker/Dockerfile ./
# - This assumes the build context is the webserver/ subrepo (see references to requirements.txt)

# Use official Python docker image to create the build artifacts.
# - The multi-stage pattern is being used since various Python dependencies require compilation
#   to occur and we don't want to include the compiler toolchain in the final image.
# - Normally Alpine would be a good choice, but by using Debian (e.g. slim-buster)
#   it's easier to be compatible out of the box with various Python dependencies
