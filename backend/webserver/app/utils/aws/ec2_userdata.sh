# The Host Service gets built in the `whist-build-and-deploy.yml` workflow and
# uploaded from this Git repository to the AMI during Packer via ami_config.json
# Here, we write the systemd unit file for the Whist Host Service.
# Note that we do not restart the host service. This is because if the host
# service dies for some reason, it is not safe to restart it, since we cannot
# tell the status of the existing cloud storage directories. We just need to
# wait for them to unmount (that is an asynchronous process) and the webserver
# should declare the host dead and prune it.
