# Webserver Documentation

This subfolder contains the long-form documentation for the Whist webserver, which gets autogenerated with Sphinx and hosted on our internal documentation website, [docs.whist.com](https://docs.whist.com).

# Building

You can build the documentation by running `make html` from this folder. The makefiles for both Unix and Windows are automatically generated by Sphinx and should not be modified.

# Publishing

The webserver documentation gets published to [docs.whist.com/webserver](https://docs.whist.com/webserver) automatically on every merge to `dev` which contains modifications to the documentation, via the `webserver-build-documentation.yml` workflow.
