/* add-subscription-status-claim.js

   Add the status of the authenticated user's Whist Stripe subscription as the
   value of the custom https://api.fractal.co/subscription_status access token
   claim.

   The subscription status is recomputed every time a new access token is
   issued. In a worst case scenario, it is possible for the user's subscription
   to expire before their access token does. This would allow them to continue
   using Whist for up to one access token lifetime, which is twenty-four
   hours.
