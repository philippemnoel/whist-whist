// Package dbdriver contains the database-interfacing code for the host
// service.
//
// Here we explain some design decisions that went into choosing the tech stack
// for this particular package. Note that these decisions are not at all final,
// but I (@djsavvy) spent quite a while evaluating different technologies and
// therefore want to explain the reasoning behind the decisions that were
// ultimately made for v1 of this package.
//
// Q: Why use `pgx`?
// A: It is blessed by the official Go documentation and is not deprecated.
// It's also pretty well-documented, especially considering some of the other
// libraries I ran into.
//
// Q: Why not use `gorm`?
// A: Our existing database conventions are quite different from those
// recommened by `gorm`, which means that we would have to write quite a bit of
// boilerplate anyways. It is also slow, and everywhere online that I saw
// mentions of `gorm` I also saw complaints about issues arising when you stray
// off a specific happy path of usage. I also noticed broken english and
// vaguenesses in critical spots of the documentation that led me to believe
// using `gorm` would not actually save any time/effort compared to just
// writing close-to-raw SQL with `pgx`.
//
// Q: Why not use `sqlboiler`?
// A: The idea of generating code based on the schema caught my attention,
// since it would help us ensure that changes to the schema also get reflected
// in the host-service code. However, the specific implementation proposed by
// `sqlboiler` isn't well-suited to our deployment since it would require us to
// spin up a local webserver deployment every time we wanted to build the host
// service. A solution that worked directly with `schema.sql` (which
// `sqlboiler` does not, as far as I can tell) would be ideal. Using
// `sqlboiler` would also require not to use views, which might be a
// dealbreaker down the line.
//
// Q: Why not use `xo`?
// A: This library is interesting for the same reason as `sqlboiler`. However,
// it expects us to use `pq` as the Postgres driver, which is deprecated.
//
// Q: Why use `pgx`'s interface instead of the standard `database/sql` one?  A:
// Honestly I found `pgx`'s interface better-documented. The list of advantages
// at
// https://github.com/JackC/pgx#choosing-between-the-pgx-and-databasesql-interfaces
// also puts some weight on the `pgx` side of the scale. Graceful null value
// handling is particularly useful. Also, being able to use Postgres' native
// notify/listen is likely to come in useful as we move towards a pub/sub
// system.
//
// Q: Why not use `squirrel` or `goqu`?
// A: These SQL builders look quite helpful and pleasant to use. However,
// neither offers a solution to the problem of the DB schema changing from
// under us. We want to make 100% sure that changing the schema also requires
// us to change the relevant code, to prevent issues in production.
//
// Q: Why use `pggen` over `sqlc`?
// A: If you've read this far, you know that using the existing `schema.sql`
// file as the single source of truth is a hard requirement. This leaves pretty
// much two options: `pggen` and `sqlc`. While `sqlc` has many more stars on
// Github, `pggen` provides the following advantages:
// - It actually works. `sqlc` was spitting out errors based on our existing
//   `schema.sql`, but since `pggen` uses Postgres to parse the schema it handled
//   it seamlessly. We can also use whatever Postgres extensions we please.
// - `pggen` has significantly better documentation, though it's less fancy.
// - `pgx` support is very immature in `sqlc` at the time of this writing
//   (merged into master 4 days ago, has not officially been released).
