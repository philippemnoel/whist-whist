                Welcome to Fractal v2. You've made it to the top of the waitlist
                üìà and we're giving you access to be the first to try our
                product, completely free üí∏ while we're in beta-testing.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                What is Fractal? Today we stream üåä six applications: Google
                Chrome, Figma, Firefox, Slack, Blender, and Brave Browser.
                Normally, these apps can consume gigabytes of RAM and slow down
                your computer. With Fractal, each app only uses less than 150MB
                RAM and runs ultra-fast üèÉ on cloud CPUs+GPUs.

            <div class="section-header">What features are coming next?</div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We're currently working on features that let you upload your
                files, remember your app settings/login credentials, and reduce
                loading times. We're also looking to stream other apps based on
                your feedback. If there's an app you use that you'd like to
                stream next, please let us know.

                We've chosen you as one of our first beta testers because we
