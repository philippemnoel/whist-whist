            Whist works by streaming Google Chrome from our datacenters to
            your computer. Because Google Chrome is being streamed to your
            computer from a datacenter in the form of video pixels, there are
            two types of security to consider: security of your browsing stream
            and security of your browsing data.

            Each of your packets is encrypted at every leg of the journey
            between your PC and your cloud browser using ephemeral keys for each
            session.

          <p className="mt-8 text-gray-400 leading-8 text-left">
            These packets are only decrypted once they&lsquo;re at the end of
            their journey. We discard your keystrokes, audio, and video
            immediately after they are replayed.

            We know what you&lsquo;re thinking: If Whist saves my cookies and
            history, can&lsquo;t they see all of it? No â€” your session data is
            never stored unencrypted. Further, the encryption key for that data
            lives in 2 places: on your computer and temporarily on your cloud
            browser so it can decrypt your session data at the start of your
            session and re-encrypt it at the end of the session. That key never
            touches our permanent storage, so even if a malicious actor were to
            gain access to our system, they would just see blobs of binary
            noise.
