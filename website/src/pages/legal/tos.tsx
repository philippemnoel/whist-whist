          <p>
            Whist is a provider of cloud-based applications ("Cloud
            Applications"). Cloud Applications are similar to a regular
            applications in that once your Whist subscription is active, they
            can be interacted with as you normally would with a local version of
            the application, except that they are installed on remote machines
            and delivered to your local device via the Whist streaming service.
            Unless indicated otherwise, your Whist Cloud Applications run on
            Linux Ubuntu 20.04. These applications are developed by
            third-parties and are serviced via Whist in agreements with the
            applications Terms of Services. By using any application through
            Whist, you consent to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of the
            application you use, in addition to Whist's Terms of Service and
            Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review an application's Terms of
            Service and Privacy Policy before using it through Whist. For
            applications which require a user license to use, this license will
            either be provided by us to you for the duration of your usage of
            the application, or you will be required to supply it yourself
            before being able to use the application via Whist, either of which
            will be made clear to you before your usage of the application.
            Whist does not support using license-requiring applications without
            a valid license and will immediately, without prenotice or refund,
            terminate any account which is found attempting to do so in any way
            whatsoever. Whist also reserves the rights to terminate any account,
            without prenotice or refund, if it is found breaking the Terms of
            Service of a specific application serviced via Whist as a Cloud
            Application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whist is committed to our users' privacy and security, which why we
            do not store the data within your applications after you terminate a
            Whist Session. A Whist session (“Session”) occurs each time you use
            Whist’s software to access a cloud-based application via Whist. Each
            Session is standalone, meaning that the remote machine running the
            application(s) you are using during a Session will be permanently
            erased shortly after you terminate your Session. As such, Whist
            offers multiple ways to effortlessly store your data with
            third-party cloud storage providers, provided that you have a valid
            account and subscription to one or many of those services. Whist
            does not assume responsibility for any lost user data due to
            incorrect or forgotten saves, or data storage issues with
            third-party integrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exceptions to this rule might include application settings, plugins
            and third-party account integrations which you specify and install
            so to customize your Whist experience for a specific Cloud
            Application. Whist may store this data on your behalf to improve
            your experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Cloud Applications Whist services can be accessed via Whist from
            any Internet-connected device (a “User Device”), provided that a
            Whist local or web application has been developed for the device’s
            operating system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the nature of cloud-based personal computing, your inputs
            (keystrokes, mouse/touchpad movements, etc.) are sent from the User
            Device to Fractal’s data center infrastructure, where Cloud
            Applications are hosted. The servers in Fractal’s data center
            infrastructure interpret these signals on your Cloud Applications,
            which allows for the Whist applications to display the Cloud
            Applications. All communications between your User Device and your
            Whist Cloud Applications, including input, audio and video
            components of the streaming, are fully AES encrypted, and Whist does
            not observe directly any of your stream components.

            Whist Plans And Subscriptions
          </p>
          <p>
            A Whist plan is your subscription to access your Cloud Applications.
            Your subscription period will be calculated from the date on which
            your Whist account is set up and available for use (the “Start
            Date”). You will receive an email informing you of that date when
            you sign up for our service. The subscription will continue from the
            Start Date for the term you selected (the “Subscription Period”) and
            will then automatically renew for successive periods equal to your
            then-current subscription term, unless no later than the day
            preceding the end of the then-current term you have cancelled your
            subscription. The renewed subscription will be on the same terms as
            the current subscription, unless we have amended our pricing or
            other terms before the renewal date, which you will be informed of
            ahead of time should it happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cost to you of the Services is the price that was agreed by you
            when you purchased your subscription. This price will remain
            unchanged until the end of your then-current Subscription Period.
            For example, if your subscription period is 30 days, then the cost
            to you will stay the same within the 30 days of that period, payable
            at the beginning of said period. We will inform you reasonably in
            advance of any proposed increase in the price of the Services you
            have purchased. You will have the opportunity to approve or decline
            the renewal of your subscription at the new price, before it is
            charged to your account. However if you have not agreed to the new
            price by the effective date of the proposed price increase, we may
            at our discretion cancel your subscription at the end of the
            then-current Subscription Period, or transition you subscription to
            the plan which is most similar to your then-current subscription.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you selected a monthly plan, or a longer plan that involves
            monthly payments, you will generally be charged a full month at the
            time of purchase of your subscription. If you selected a plan with a
            per-usage pricing component, you will be charged the usage unit
            times the usage you have made of the Services at the end of the time
            period, typically a month, based on your usage. If you use part of
            an usage unit, but not the full usage unit, say if you are billed
            hourly but only use part of an hour, you will be charged a full unit
            of usage. Subsequent monthly payments will be charged on or about
            the same date in every subsequent month of the Subscription Period
            (or renewed Subscription Period). If you selected a prepaid plan,
            you will generally be charged the full amount of the plan at the
            time of purchase of your subscription.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for making on-time payments for your Whist
            subscription, as well as for updating relevant payment information
            in the case of any changes. Whist reserves the right to suspend your
            access to any and all Whist services if you do not make a payment on
            time, and/or charge late payment fees equal to ten (10) US dollars
            per default per week. There may be a delay in return to normal
            Services after default payments have been rendered. If Whist does
            not receive payment for your Whist plan on the day of renewal and
            you have not cancelled your Whist plan, your Services will be
            suspended. If your Services are suspended, Whist is not responsible
            for any refund of previous payments (nor is Whist responsible for
            refunds of previous payments in other situations), and you are still
            responsible for the entire subscription fee outstanding, meaning you
            are still responsible for the entire subscription fee of the current
            subscription period, as defined in your Whist plan. If Services are
            cancelled by Whist because of a failure to pay, the entire remaining
            subscription fee for the subscription period will be payable to
            Whist immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may receive offers to purchase additional optional services from
            Whist or to change your subscription plan. For the most part, those
            changes will be accessible from the User Account. In the case that
            you purchase additional optional services, your purchase of those
            services will become effective immediately, subject to the time
            needed for activation. The optional services or upgrades will be
            billed instantly on a pro rata basis from the date of activation to
            the end of the then-current Subscription Period. Going forward from
            that point, the optional services or upgrades will be added onto the
            main subscription and billed in cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you would like to change subscription plans to a lower-priced
            plan, or you would like to remove optional services, the change
            and/or removal will take effect on the first day of the next
            Subscription Period after the then-current Subscription Period.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold", fontSize: 20 }}>Referral Programs</p>

            From time to time, Whist may offer its Users benefits for referring
            new additional customers to Whist. Access to any such program is
            subject to compliance with these Terms by both the User and the

            the three cloud providers from which Whist services cloud-based
            applications. Other cloud providers may be added from time-to-time
            to enable Whist to service more users. If this is the case, you will
            be notified ahead of time. By making continuous usage of the Whist
            Services following the addition of a new cloud provider by Whist,
            you express your agreement of their Terms of Service.

            and share the User Content, for the intended functioning of the
            User’s Cloud Applications. User Content is not stored by Whist, with
            the exception of third-party authentication integrations, plugins

            We expect you to comply with these Terms. Whist reserves the right
            to suspend the Services, without notice, if you breach these Terms
            (including, in particular, in the event of a payment default or a
            violation of our Code of Conduct, which can be found above in these

          <p>
            The Whist Services are only supported in the regions and countries
            listed on our website at the time of signup. Because of the nature
            of the Internet, Whist Cloud Applications might be accessible in the
            country or region in which you are physically present at a specific
            moment, even if this country or region is not part of the officially
            supported regions on our website. Furthermore, access from those
            other geographies may be possible, but the distance between the User
            and the Whist data center infrastructure may cause diminished
            material quality of Services. Whist only guarantees quality of
            service in officially supported regions; usage of the Whist Services
            outside of those territories is not endorsed by Whist and the User
            is reponsible to respect the local laws, privacy regulations and
            other restrictions which may be imposed upon them by local
            authorities. Whist declines all liabilities for usage of our

            These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Whist
            with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and
            replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and

            Fractal’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms shall not be
            deemed a waiver of its right to do so in the future. If a provision
            of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining
            provisions of these Terms will remain in full effect and an
            enforceable term will be substituted reflecting as closely as
            possible the intent of the parties. You may not assign any of your
            rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Whist
            may assign its rights to any of its affiliates, or to any successor
            in interest of any business associated with the Services.

            Applicable Law; Disputes
          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms will be governed by Connecticut, U.S.A. law except for
            its conflicts of laws principles, unless otherwise required by a
            mandatory law of any other jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parties shall endeavor to settle any disputes regarding these
            Terms or the Services amicably before submitting the case to the
            competent courts.
          </p>
          <p>
            To that effect, before filing a claim against us, you agree to try
            to resolve the dispute informally by opening a support ticket via
            email to <a href="mailto:support@whist.com">support@whist.com</a>.
            We will try to resolve the dispute informally. If a dispute is not
            resolved within fifteen days of submission, you or we may bring a
            formal proceeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or
            the Services shall be brought in the federal or state courts of
            Fairfield County, Connecticut, subject to the mandatory arbitration
            provisions below. By accepting these terms, you consent to our
            choice of venue and submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and/or
            state courts of Fairfield County, Connecticut (or other courts, if
            we so choose).

            Mandatory Arbitration
          </p>
          <p>
            You and we agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or
            the Services through final and binding arbitration by the American
            Arbitration Association (AAA), in accordance with its Commercial
            Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
            Related Disputes. The AAA rules will govern payment of all
            arbitration fees. The arbitration will be held in the United States
            county where you live or work or in Fairfield County, Connecticut,
            or any other location we agree upon. If the agreement to arbitrate
            is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the
            exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Fairfield
            County, Connecticut to resolve your claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can opt-out of the requirement to arbitrate by emailing{" "}
            <a href="mailto:support@whist.com">support@whist.com</a> with the
            subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out” within 30 days of the date you
            first register your account. You can obtain the opt-form, free of
            charge, by contacting Whist via the email address provided. This
            step is not necessary if you have already opted-out in a previous
            version of these terms: your previous decision regarding arbitration
            is still binding unless you update it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or we may assert claims in
            small claims court in Fairfield County (CT) or any United States
            county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit
            solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of
            the Services, violation of these Terms, or intellectual property
            infringement without first engaging in arbitration or the informal
            dispute-resolution process described above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions,
            and consolidation with other arbitrations are NOT allowed. You may
            not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class,
            consolidated, or representative action. You may only resolve
            disputes with us on an individual basis. If this specific paragraph
            is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Mandatory
            Arbitration Provisions" section will be deemed void.
