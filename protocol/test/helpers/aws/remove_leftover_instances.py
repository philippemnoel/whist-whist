# Before exiting, the streaming_e2e_tester.py script stops/terminates all EC2 instances

# However, if streaming_e2e_tester.py crashes, it will likely do so before completing the cleanup.
# To handle this scenario, this additional script will search for any leftover instances, and terminate
# or stop them (depending on whether they are new instances or reused ones).
