## Fractal Windows/Linux Ubuntu Server

This code turns a Windows or Linux Ubuntu computer into a server listening to receive a client connection to stream its desktop to at ultra-low latency over the Internet.

It should be easily built via `make` (on Linux Ubuntu with gcc) or `nmake` (on Windows with MSVC - requires Visual Studio Desktop Development Extension). Tested with `Visual Studio Community Edition 2019`.
