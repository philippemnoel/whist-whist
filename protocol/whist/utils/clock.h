Usage
============================

You can use start_timer and get_timer to time specific pieces of code, or to
relate different events across server and client.

 * Example:
 * @code{.c}
 * WhistTimer timer;
 * start_timer(&timer);
 * foo();
 * printf("foo() took %f seconds to run.", get_timer(&timer));
 * @endcode
