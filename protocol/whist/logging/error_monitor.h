 * @file error_monitor.h
 * @brief This file contains the functions to configure and report breadcrumbs
 *        and error events to tools such as Sentry.
============================
Usage
============================
The error monitor needs to have an environment configured before it can be
started up. This environment should be development/staging/production, and is
passed in as a command-line parameter. Once the value is known, we may call
`error_monitor_set_environment()` to configure it.

If no environment is set, the error monitor will fail to initialize. This is
because we don't want it to complain in personal setups and manual connections
when developing, but it's important to note the side-effect that we will not
report to the error monitoring service if environment isn't passed in.

To initialize the error monitor, we call `error_monitor_initialize()`. After
doing so, we can configure the error logging metadata with
`error_monitor_set_username()` and `error_monitor_set_connection_id()`.

At this point, calling `error_monitor_log_breadcrumb()` and
`error_monitor_log_error()` will report a trace of non-error events and report
a detailed breakdown for error-level events to the error monitor service,
respectively. Importantly, *you should almost never be calling this function by
itself*. Instead, simply use the `LOG_*()` functions from logging.h, which will
automatically send error monitor breadcrumbs and error reports as needed.

Because of this integration with our logging setup, we run into race conditions
in `error_monitor_shutdown()`, which may cause us to fail to report our last
few breadcrumbs and error events. In order to avoid this, we must call
`error_monitor_shutdown()` after calling `destroy_logger()`, to allow for any
pending error monitor log calls to be handled. Eventually, we should set up
a more robust solution for synchronizing these calls.
