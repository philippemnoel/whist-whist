## Desktop Local Client

This code launches a desktop (Windows, MacOS, Linux) into a client initiating a connection to their cloud virtual machine for interactive usage over the network.

It should be easily built via `make` (on MacOS and Linux) or `nmake` (on Windows). Tested with `Visual Studio Community Edition 2019`.

## Running
