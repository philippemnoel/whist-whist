## Desktop Client

This code launches a desktop (Windows, MacOS, Linux Ubuntu) into a client initiating a connection to their cloud virtual machine for interactive usage over the network.

It should be easily built via `make` (on MacOS with clang and Linux Ubuntu with gcc) or `nmake` (on Windows with Visual Studio Desktop Development Extension). Tested with `Visual Studio Community Edition 2019`.

## Running (MacOS, Linux Ubuntu)
