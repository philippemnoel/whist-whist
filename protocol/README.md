# Fractal Protocol

This repository contains the source code for the Fractal Protocol, which streams in real-time a desktop environment or specific application from a virtual machine or container to a user's local client (Desktop OSes, iOS, Android, Cube/Slate (RPi), etc.) at ultra-low latency.

The Protocol Server runs on Windows 10 or Linux Ubuntu virtual machines/containers.

The Protocol Clients are divided into four categories:
- Desktop (Windows, MacOS, Linux Ubuntu)
- iOS/iPadOS
- Android/Chromebook
- Web
