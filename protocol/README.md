## Development

We use Cmake to compile, format and run tests. You first need to make sure Cmake 3.15 or higher is installed on your system. We also use cppcheck to run static tests on the code, which you should install as well. If you are running on Windows, you also need to make sure the Nvidia CUDA Compiler, NVCC, is installed with version 10.2 or higher to compile our CUDA code.

### Installation

#### Linux

If you are using a rolling release distro, e.g. Arch, then you can likely install the newest version using pacman or your
distro's package manager. If you are running 20.04 the version in the Ubuntu package lists is fine. If you are running 18.04 the package lists only has 3.11. You can install the newest version from the developer with:

```
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg software-properties-common wget -y
wget -O - https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc 2>/dev/null | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ bionic main'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake -y
```

You can install cppcheck via your package manager, e.g. `apt-get install cppcheck`.

#### MacOS

You can install both Cmake and cppcheck via Homebrew. You also need to have installed Xcode and installed the Xcode CLI tools, which you can install by running `xcode-select --install` in a terminal after having installed Xcode.

```
brew install cmake cppcheck
```

##### Windows

First you will have to install [gitbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You can install Cmake with the latest binaries [here](https://cmake.org/download/), and cppcheck with Chocolatey by running `choco install cppcheck --force`. This will ensure you can properly debug the protocol.

In order to compile it, you need to first install [Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and select `Desktop Development with C++` add-on in the installer. This will install different Visual Studio Command Prompts for different architectures. In order to compile the protocol, you need to make sure to be using x86_x64 Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt.

You also need to install the Nvidia CUDA Compiler, NVCC. You'll need [Toolkit version 10.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.2-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exenetwork) instead of the latest 11.0, since this is the one we use on our production VMs currently. If you have an Nvidia GPU, feel free to install all the components if you don't mind overwriting your display driver with whatever comes with the 10.2 release. If you don't have an Nvidia GPU, you have to be careful which components you install. At the Options page of the installer, choose the Custom Install. Don't install the Driver components or the Other components (it might be bad to overwrite your driver if you don't have an Nvidia GPU or you don't want the driver packaged with the 10.2 release). Meanwhile, under CUDA, you MUST install the Development→Compiler and Runtime→Library. Everything else is optional, though you might find the extra tools, samples, or visual studio integration useful.

After doing this, you might have to restart your terminal or IDE, after which you'll be able to build using CMake.

### Building

If you are on Linux Ubuntu, run `desktop/linux-client-setup.sh` to install the system dependencies.

#### Sentry

To build you will need to install the sentry-native sdk. This can be done by running the python script get_latest_sentry.py in the root directory of this repo.
The SDK is a CMake project which we load in our root CMakeLists.txt.

#### IDE

We use CMake to build. If you are using VS code, VS or Clion, this is pretty easy to use. You need to either open the root repo folder as a project, or open the root `CMakelist.txt` as a project. On CLion and VS there is a menu to build at the top, on VS code you need the CMake extension and the build command is at the bottom. CMake currently has two types of builds, Debug and Release. You probably want to be building debug builds while developing, since they log more aggressively (Warning levels: Info and above).

Currently, we use the same compiler flags for Debug and Release because we distribute binaries with debug flags, to better troubleshoot errors and bugs.

The build target for desktop is "FractalClient" and the sever is "FractalServer".

#### MacOS CLI

You can simply run `cmake .` from the root folder, `/protocol/`, which will generate the makefiles. You can then run `make FractalClient` from the root folder, or cd into `/desktop` and run `make` to compile the MacOS client.

#### Linux CLI

Install cmake and ccmake; ccmake is a TUI for configuring the build. From the root of the repo run `ccmake .`. You will initially see a blank screen because no cache has been built yet. Hit `c` to configure. This will populate the cache and show you a page with various settings. The three you care about are `BUILD_CLIENT` and `BUILD_SERVER` which are both `ON` or `OFF`, and `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` which is one of `Debug` or `Release`.

Next hit `c` again to reconfigure with your possibly new settings, then hit `g` to generate the makefile. This makefile has all of the build targets, including FractalClient, FractalServer and all of our libraries. It also includes CMake targets such as clean, edit_cache and rebuild cache.

Only running `make` defaults to building FractalClient and FractalServer if you set both of these to ON in your configuration.
GCC only supports one type of build at a time, so if you are currently building Release, but want to build Debug, you need to edit the cache and regenerate the makefile.

If you would like to keep your repo cleaner, make a build folder in `/protocol` and run `cmake` from there, e.g. `cd "build & cmake ../."`. This way, you can just delete the contents of the build folder to start over.

#### Windows CLI

To build on Windows, run the command `cmake -G "NMake Makefiles"` at the root directory from an x86_64 Visual Studio Developper Command Prompt, which is obtained through downloading Visual Studio. This tells CMake to generate NMake-style makefiles. Then, run `nmake` in either `/server` or `/desktop`, depending on which one you want to compile.

#### Further documentation

More documentation is in our [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T9Lc3HVoqhqSjdUbiaFaQU71oV1VH25iFGDNvAYjtOs/edit?usp=sharing), if needed. We also use Doxygen in this repository. The Doxy file is `docs/Doxyfile`. To generate it, you should first install doxygen via your local package manager, and run `doxygen Doxyfile`. This will generate the docs and put them in `docs/html` and `docs/latex`. You can view the html docs by opening the index.html page with a web browser. We keep the docs gitignored to avoid clutter on the repository, since we don't publish them anywhere.

## CI & CD

### Continuous Deployment

Every commit to `dev`, `staging` and `master`, as well as each new PR opened or updated, results in a new build being created an uploaded to GitHub Releases. These builds are versioned using the following scheme `GITREF-YYYYMMDD.#`, where

-   `GITREF` is either the branch name (such as `dev`) or the PR info (such as `pr255merge` for the merge commit on PR #255)
-   `YYYYMMDD` is the current UTC date
-   `#` is an incrementing integer to disambiguate multiple releases on the same date

A build of the `client-applications` will also be triggered for each new `protocol` build. See that repository's README for more information.

#### Checks & Tests

These builds will also have `cppcheck` run against them which is a static analysis tool which can catch errors which compilers cannot, e.g. accessing uninitialized memory and other undefined behavior. Not everything it catches is critical, but it does indicate the possibility of unexpected behavior.

These builds will also (TODO) be tested against a live server VM. This workflow will spin up an Azure VM, upload the server build to it, and then use GitHub Actions VMs on Windows, MacOS and Linux Ubuntu as clients to connect and stream via the protocol for one minute. This will also occur nightly against the `dev` branch, but these builds will not be released (this can be removed once testing is stable and re-enabled on all commits).

To see the warnings in context go to the Actions tab, click on your PR/push that launched the action, select an OS it ran on and then select build. This expands the build log, where you can clearly see the warnings/errors generated.

### Testing on VMs

As mentioned above, every commit to `dev`, `staging` and `master` and every new PR results in a build being uploaded to Github Releases. The server build in this release can be easily uploaded to a VM for testing using the `deploy_server_release.py` script. The script requires that you specify the IP address of a VM that is currently running and also allows you to specify the specific release to test, defaulting to the latest release on `dev`. For example, to run the server build in the latest release in the `staging` branch on the VM at IP address 52.168.66.248, you can run `python deploy_server_release.py --vm-ip=52.168.66.248 --release=latest:staging`. To see other optional arguments that are exposed, just open up `deploy_server_release.py`.

### Special Cases

You can add `WIP` anywhere in the title of a PR to keep the CD auto-build workflow from running

You can include `skip-ci` anywhere in a commit message to `dev`, `staging`, or `master` to keep the CD auto-build workflow from running.

### Continuous Integration

For every push or PR, the code will be automatically linted via clang-format according to the [styling](#styling) guidelines.

## Styling

For `.c` and `.h` files, we are formatting using the clang format `{BasedOnStyle: Google, IndentWidth: 4}`. You can download clang-format via the package manager for your respective OS:

```
MacOS:
brew install clang-format

Linux Ubuntu:
apt-get install clang-format

Windows:
choco install llvm --force
```

If using VSCode or Visual Studio, please set this up in your editor to format on save if possible (in Visual Studio, this is through the C/C++ extension settings, as well as the general 'Format on Save' setting/shortcut). Otherwise, please make sure to run your code through `clang` before commits. You can run it from the CLI by running `cmake . && make clang-format`, on MacOS/Linux, or `cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" && make clang-format`, on Windows.

We have [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) with clang-format support installed on this project, which you can initialize by first installing pre-commit via `pip install pre-commit` and then running `pre-commit install` to instantiate the hooks for clang-format.

We also have a custom build target in the CMake 'clang-format' which will run with this style over all `.c` and `.h` files in `server/` `desktop/` and `fractal/`. You can call it by running `make clang-format`.
