/**

 * @file rwlock.h
 * @brief This file contains a write-preferred read-write lock.
============================
Usage
============================

RWLocks must be initialized before use and should be destroyed before program
exit. RWLocks are not allocated or freed by init_rw_lock or destroyRWLock,
respectively.

Only one thread may write-hold the RWLock at once. Arbitrarily many threads may
read-hold the RWLock at once.

The RWLock is write-preferred. If a writer is waiting for the lock and a reader
requests the lock, the writer will always be granted the lock before the reader.
If multiple writers wait for the lock at once, the lock will be granted to the
writers, one at a time, in the order of their requesting the lock.

The functions for acquiring the RWLock are blocking and will block indefinitely.
