 * @brief This file contains all code that interacts directly with sockets
 *        under-the-hood.
============================
Usage
============================

SocketContext: This type represents a socket.
   - To use a socket, call CreateUDPContext or CreateTCPContext with the desired
     parameters
   - To send data over a socket, call SendTCPPacket or SendUDPPacket
   - To receive data over a socket, call ReadTCPPacket or ReadUDPPacket
   - If there is belief that a packet wasn't sent, you can call ReplayPacket to
     send a packet twice

FractalPacket: This type represents a packet of information
   - Unique packets of a given type will be given unique IDs. IDs are expected
     to be increasing monotonically, with a gap implying that a packet was lost
   - FractalPackets that were thought to have been sent may not arrive, and
     FractalPackets may arrive out-of-order, in the case of UDP. This will not
     be the case for TCP, however TCP sockets may lose connection if there is a
     problem.
   - A given block of data will, during transmission, be split up into packets
     with the same type and ID, but indicies ranging from 0 to num_indices - 1
   - A missing index implies that a packet was lost
   - A FractalPacket is only guaranteed to have data information from 0 to
     payload_size - 1 data[] occurs at the end of the packet, so extra bytes may
     in-fact point to invalid memory to save space and bandwidth
   - A FractalPacket may be sent twice in the case of packet recovery, but any
     two FractalPackets found that are of the same type and ID will be expected
     to have the same data (To be specific, the Client should never legally send
     two distinct packets with same ID/Type, and neither should the Server, but
if the Client and Server happen to both make a PACKET_MESSAGE packet with ID 1
     they can be different)
   - To reconstruct the original datagram from a sequence of FractalPackets,
     concatenated the data[] streams (From 0 to payload_size - 1) for each index
     from 0 to num_indices - 1
