 * @brief This contains logging utils to log repeated statistics, where we
 *        don't want to print every time.
============================
Usage
============================

Call log_double_statistic(key, value) repeatedly within a loop with the same string `key` to store a
double `val`. If it's been PRINTING_FREQUENCY_IN_SEC, the call will also print some statistics about
the stored values for each key (up to MAX_DIFFERENT_STATISTICS keys) and flush the data. This can
also be done manually with print_statistics().
