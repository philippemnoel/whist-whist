============================
Usage
============================

handle_frontend_events() should be periodically called in the main loop to poll and handle
frontend events, including input, mouse motion, and resize events.

TODO: Combine this with sdl_utils.h in some way

/**
 * @brief                          Flushes the SDL event queue, and
 *                                 handles all of the pending events.
 *                                 Calling this function repeatedly is necessary,
 *                                 otherwise "Application not responding" or a Mac beachball
 *                                 may appear.  If no events are available immediately, waits
 *                                 for up to the given timeout for any events to appear.  Once
 *                                 any event happens it will not deliberately wait longer.
 *
 * @param frontend                 The frontend instance.
 * @param timeout_ms               How long to wait for events before returning anyway.
 *
 * @returns                        True on success,
 *                                 False on failure
 *
 * @note                           This function call MAY occasionally hang for an indefinitely long
 *                                 time. To see an example of this, simply drag the window on
 *                                 MSWindows, or hold down the minimize button on Mac.
 *                                 To see more information on this issue, and my related rant,
 *                                 go to https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/1059
