 * @brief This file contains the client's adaptive bitrate code. Any algorithms we are using for
 *        predicting bitrate should be stored here.
============================
Usage
============================
Place to put any predictive/adaptive bitrate algorithms. In the current setup, each algorithm is a
function that takes in inputs through a BitrateStatistics struct. The function is responsible for
maintaining any internal state necessary for the algorithm (possibly through the use of custom types
or helpers), and should update client_max_bitrate when necessary.

To change the algorithm the client uses, set `calculate_new_bitrate` to the desired algorithm.
The function assigned to `calculate_new_bitrate` should have signature such that it takes
one argument of type `BitrateStatistics` and returns type `Bitrates`.

        of a heuristic for finding current throughput, every `same_throughput_count_threshold`

        `same_throughput_count_threshold` so that the successful throughput stays constant
        for longer and longer periods of time before we try higher bitrates. We follow a similar
        logic flow for the burst bitrate, except we use skipped renders instead of NACKs.
