 * @brief This file exposes platform-independent APIs for
 *        native window modifications not handled by SDL.
============================
Usage
============================

Use these functions to modify the appearance or behavior of the native window
underlying the SDL window. These functions will almost always need to be called
from the same thread as SDL window creation and SDL event handling; usually this
is the main thread.
