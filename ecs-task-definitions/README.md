# Fractal ECS Task Definitions

This repository contains the JSON task definitions for each of the applications we stream via containers on AWS Elastic Container Service. Each application we stream has its dedicated JSON task definition.

You can retrieve the JSON of a task definition directly in the AWS console when manually testing and developing a new task ahead of production release, and then add it here for version-tracking.
