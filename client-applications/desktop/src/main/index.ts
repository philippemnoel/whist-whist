// This is the application's main entry point. No code should live here, this

// This file should import every other file in the top-level of the "main
// folder. While many of those files import each other and would run anyways,
// we import everything here first for the sake of being explicit.
//
// If you've created a new file in "main/" and you're not seeing it run, you
// probably haven't imported it here.
