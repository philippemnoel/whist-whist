# Fractal Client Applications

This repository contains the source code for the Fractal Cocal Applications which users can download on their local device (Desktop OSes, iOS, Android, etc.) to connect to their cloud computer and start the streaming protocol.

There is only the front-end and basic OS-specific functionalities in the repository, but main executables from /fractal-protocol and /fractal-uploaders are necessary to include in the download package so that the backend can work properly.

The following are left to implement:

- Cross-Platform Desktop (Windows, MacOS, Linux Ubuntu)
- iOS/iPadOS
- Android/Chromebook

The release versions of the executables are hosted on S3: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/fractal-applications-release/?region=us-east-1&tab=overview
