# Fractal Client Applications

This repository contains the Fractal client applications, which users download to their local device to connect to their Fractal computer (cloud or peer-to-peer streaming). Each subfolder contains the appropriate code for its platform, each with a proper README with information on how to develop or build each application. The web client will be part of the `fractalcomputers/website` repository and is not build in this repository.

## Supported Applications

The following platforms are supported by the Fractal applications:

- [Windows 10](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/fractal-applications-release/?region=us-east-1)
- [MacOS 10.10+](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/fractal-mac-application-release/?region=us-east-1)
- [Linux Ubuntu 18.04+](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/fractal-linux-application-release/?region=us-east-1)

For the desktop OS applications listed above, the version requirements come from the Fractal protocol; the Electron-based application should run on older versions.

The following platforms have yet to be supported:
- iOS/iPadOS
- Android/Chromebook
- Web (Note that the web client will be hosted on `fractalcomputers/website`)
