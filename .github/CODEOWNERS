# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
# The '*' pattern is global owners.
# Global rule:
*                       @whisthq/code-standard-reviewers

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# The folders are ordered as follows:

/.github/                           @philippemnoel @rpadaki @mauaraujo
/backend/auth0/                     @philippemnoel @rpadaki @owenniles
/backend/infrastructure/            @mauaraujo @rpadaki @philippemnoel
/backend/services/                  @mauaraujo @rpadaki @philippemnoel
/host-setup/                        @rpadaki @mauaraujo @philippemnoel
/mandelboxes/                       @rpadaki @mauaraujo @philippemnoel
/protocol/                          @jkarthic @npip99 @rpadaki @sardination

# In each subsection folders are ordered first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.
