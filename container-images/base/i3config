# This font is widely installed, provides lots of unicode glyphs, right-to-left
# text rendering and scalability on retina/hidpi displays (thanks to pango).
#font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 8

# Before i3 v4.8, we used to recommend this one as the default:
# font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1
# The font above is very space-efficient, that is, it looks good, sharp and
# clear in small sizes. However, its unicode glyph coverage is limited, the old
# X core fonts rendering does not support right-to-left and this being a bitmap
# font, it doesnâ€™t scale on retina/hidpi displays.

# use these keys for focus, movement, and resize directions when reaching for
# the arrows is not convenient

# Make pop-up windows actually appear as pop-ups, rather than tiled

# The following will account for a lot of them. For those that slip through,
# we need to enter a per item entry in the config along the lines of
# for_window [title="Event Tester"]                       floating enable
# for_window [class="Youtube-dl-gui"]                     floating enable
# replacing the title or class by that of the application window desired
#
# Sometimes a combination of title and class is needed. We can also use 
# the for_window setting to force size and position, if needed.
