# Unfortunately, python's subprocess module doesn't give us an easy way to run
# interactive programs (i.e. with standard in/out), so we run the actual bash
# command in the container via this script instead of in the python file. We
# need to set up some fancy indirection to store the last line of the script's
# output (which should be the docker container's ID) as $docker_id.

# Start bash in the container.
docker exec -it "$docker_id" /bin/bash || true

# Kill the container once we're done
