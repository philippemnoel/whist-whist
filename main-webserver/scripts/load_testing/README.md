# Load Testing

Load testing is a valuable tool for discovering complex bugs in our code base. Previously, it has helped identify issues with our locking mechanisms on webserver and race conditions in the host service. It runs every Sunday at 2am EST in the `main-webserver-load-testing` workflow. Load testing source is a little complex to navigate, so this README exists to help demystify all that is going on. First, the files:

```
./scripts/load_testing
├── __init__.py # packages load_testing module
├── load_test_utils.py # load test utility methods/constants
├── load_test_management.py # helps set up and tear down a load test
├── load_test_driver.py # overarching function to actually run a local load test
├── locust_load_test.py # main load test file - run by Locust
```

# Usage

The primarily user is a Github Actions chronjob workflow at `.github/workflows/main-webserver-load-testing.yml`. However, these scripts can be run locally against any of our deployed webservers (dev, staging, prod) and review apps.

## Testing Against Staging

See the workflow at `.github/workflows/main-webserver-load-testing.yml` (specifically the "Setup and run load test" step).
Those are the steps you'd need to take to setup, run, and cleanup a load test. Just open a Python shell and follow along, or make a Python file that runs as many of the commands as you'd like in one go.

## From Scratch in a Review App

1. Make a review app. See [here](https://www.notion.so/tryfractal/Steps-for-Doing-a-Webserver-Review-App-823cadbb422e401087625c69172cf4fb) for instructions.
2. Add hirefire to review app. See the hirefire [dashboard](https://manager.hirefire.io/). You'll need to configure it for the review app. Copy the configurations for dev. You should get a command of the form `heroku config:add -a <HEROKU_REVIEW_APP_NAME> HIREFIRE_TOKEN=<HIREFIRE_TOKEN>` to run.
3. Run `load_test_management.py:make_load_test_user` for however many concurrent users you plan on doing.
4. Follow the steps for testing against `staging`.
5. For cleanup, remember to delete the Hirefire application. Of course, also remember to do the usual cleanup steps shown in the workflow.

# Design Decisions

There were many design considerations in this PR. The most relevant ones are summarized below:

1. We want something that used existing solutions and scaled well to different future use-cases we might have. Two such potential future use-cases are distributed load testing and simulating user actions with their containers. We eventually settled on Locust, which makes it relatively easy to run load tests locally (as we do now) and has potential to scale with projects like https://github.com/FutureSharks/invokust. Simulating actions in containers can be done with `@locust.task` inside `locust_load_test.py:LoadTestUser`. Right now we only implement the `on_start` method to get the container.
2. We chose to run the tests against staging because standing up a review app periodically or adding a new app to Fractal's Heroku account had too much overhead. This adds further purpose to staging as an intermediary between fast-moving, quickly changing `dev` and stable, user-facing `prod`.
