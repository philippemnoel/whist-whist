        Hi there,
      </p>
      <p style="color: #111111;">
        We wanted to let you know that unfortunately a payment attempt on your
        account has failed. Please verify with your financial provider and renew
        your payment.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #111111;">
        If payment has not been resolved before your plan renewal date, your access
        to Fractal will be automatically revoked.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #111111;">
        If you have any questions or feedback, you can reach out to
        support@fractal.co.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="color: #111111;">
        Sincerely, <br />
        The Fractal Team
      </p>
