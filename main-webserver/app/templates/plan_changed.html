        Hi there,
      </p>
      <p style="color: #111111;">
        We wanted to let you know that your request to change your plan has been
        successful. You are now on the <strong>{{plan}}</strong> plan. The
        remaining days on your previous plan were automatically credited towards
        your new plan, which goes into effect immediately.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #111111;">
        If using a daily or hourly plan, your hourly charges have been updated
        automatically.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #111111;">
        If you have any questions or feedback, you can reach out to
        support@fractal.co.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="color: #111111;">
        Sincerely, <br />
        The Fractal Team
      </p>
