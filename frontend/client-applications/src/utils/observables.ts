        Description:
            A helper that automates the creation of a "loading" observable.

        Arguments:
            request: An observable whose emissions represent the "start" of a
                     loading process.
            ...ends: A list of observables whose emissions represent the "end"
                     of a loading process.
        Returns:
            An observable that emits "true" when "request" emits, and "false"
            as soon as any of the "...ends" observables emit. Only one "end"
            observable should emit at a time, any subsequent "end" emissions
            will be ignored until "request" emits again.

        Description:
            An adorable little helper to perform a function on a time interval.

        Arguments:
            step: A number of milliseconds to wait between each function call.
            func: A function that returns a value, a Promise, or an
                  observable.
        Returns:
            An observable that emits the result of func at every time step. The
            observable will emit infinitely, it's up to the caller to
            unsubscribe from it. The returned observable will wait for the first
            time step before emitting its first value.
