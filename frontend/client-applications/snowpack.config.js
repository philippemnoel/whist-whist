/** @type {import("snowpack").SnowpackUserConfig } */
// This comment above enables TypeScript information in IDEs.

// This file configures Javascript compilation + bundling for both the Electron
// main process and the renderer process.
//
// Both main/renderer first have their `.ts/.tsx` files compiled by TypeScript,
// with settings from src/tsconfig.json. Outside of TypeScript, they have very
// little in common in their "bundling" procedures. This is because the main
// process will run in a NodeJS environment, and the renderer process will run
// in a browser environment.
//
// Snowpack deals almost entirely with the renderer process, we use a separate
// set of commands to bundle the main process files. However, we use Snowpack
// to provide our "hot-reload" engine for the renderer process, and Snowpack
// provides some useful "hooks" to call other commands at different stages of
// its bundling. We leverage these hooks to call some external commands that
// do the main process bundling, even though those external commands have nothing
// to do with Snowpack.
//
// This allows us to have a (mostly) seamless bundling experience. Everything
// will run on yarn start, and reload on changes.

// The main process still requires some "bundling", as its npm dependencies need
// to be packaged up with the app. We use esbuild to do this bundling for us.
// This esbuild command below is on of the "external commands" that will be run
// by a Snowpack hook.
//
// We don't want to bundle Electron. It's included automatically by the
// Electron build tooling.
//
// We follow a consistent style with our commands below, which is to write them
// out as a list, and then concatenate the list with a " " to build the final
// command.
