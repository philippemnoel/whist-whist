# Whist Teleport Extension

This project contains the server-side Whist Chromium extension, known as Teleport. It is a browser extension that we install on all server-side browsers (Chrome, Brave) to allow Whist to correlate the state of the server-side browser with the state of the client-side browser. 

For instance, we use it for synchronizing file state between the client and server when a file upload message is received, allowing us to perform file upload over the network.





## Development








TODO. We should write a README for this project.
