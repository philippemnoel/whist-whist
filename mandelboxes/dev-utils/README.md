# Whist Mandelbox Utilities

This repository contains various utilities and scripts used to experiment with pushing the limits of mandelboxes (i.e. adding FUSE support in containers), which are Whist-enabled Docker containers. Some of these utilities might be used for development and debugging, and some might end up being integrated in our production mandelboxes. If you're experimenting with novel container techniques/tools, or if you're doing some pointy optimization with our containers, please add your work here so that others can benefit from it.
