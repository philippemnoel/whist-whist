# Fractal ECS Host Service

This repository contains the Fractal ECS host service, which is installed on AWS EC2 instances running Fractal containers via AWS ECS to perform dynamic tty allocation and ensure new containers can be safely allocated on the host machine as simultaneous requests come in.

## Development

__Design Decision__: This service will not restart on crash/panic, since that could lead to an inconsistency between the actually running containers and the data left on the filesystem. Instead, we note that if the service crashes no new containers will be able to report themselves to the webserver, so there will be no new connections to the host, and once all running containers are disconnected, the instance will be spun down. 

## Publishing

TBD
